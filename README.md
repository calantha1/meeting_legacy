# Meeting

Suite of applications for performing distributed group video conferences and managing shared meeting boards.

##Â Development

All development thus-far has been performed on OS X. It is anticipated that the same mechanisms described here will also work on Linux systems.

### Dependencies

From the root directory of the project:

```bash
# global requirements
brew install ansible
brew install nodejs
brew install npm
brew install graphicsmagick
brew install ghostscript

npm install -g browserify
npm install -g nodemon

# local requirements
npm install
```

See the [React documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html#using-react-from-npm) for further notes on installation.

### Configuration

Before you are able to build the project, you will need to create some initial configuration files:

1. WebRTC requires that you provide some STUN and/or TURN (hole-punching and relay respectively) servers in order to negotate a connection.

   To do this, create `src/config.jsx` containing your ICE and TURN server details. For example,

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
       'iceServers': [
           {
               'url': 'stun:stun.services.mozilla.com'
           },
           {
               'url': 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302'
           },
           {
               'url': 'turn:relay.inseven.co.uk:3478',
               'username': 'user',
               'credential': 'pass',
           },
       ]
   };
   ```
   
    Mozilla and Google host ICE servers but do not provide TURN servers (as these are costly to run). Both the Mozilla and Google STUN servers should be safe to use, but you will need to bring your own TURN server (`relay.inseven.co.uk` does not exist).
    
    If you are using [TurnServer](http://turnserver.sourceforge.net), you will need to ensure it is configured with a suitable user in your `turnusers.txt` file (`/etc/turnserver/turnusers.txt` on Ubuntu). For example,
    
    ```
    user:pass:domain.org:authorized
    ```

### Building

From the root directory of the project:

```bash
scripts/meeting build
```

### Running

To run the project locally for testing, you can run the development server using the following command:

```bash
scripts/meeting serve
```

This simply runs the `build/service.js` file under `nodemon`. Since this uses `nodemon`, the service will be loaded when the project is rebuilt using `scripts/meeting build`.

### Deploying

#### Authentication

To provide some content protection during demos, the default Apache reverse proxy configuration provided also includes HTTP basic authentication<sup>1</sup>. 

In order to use Meeting with the default configuration provided, you will need to create and configure your `.htpasswd` and `.htgroup` files as follows:

1. Enter the users as a space-separated list in `src/.htgroup` as follows:

   ```bash
   echo "member-users: user1 user2 user3" > src/.htgroup
   ```
   
	The group name (`member-users`) is explicitly referenced in the Apache virtual host configuration and should not be changed.
	
2. Create the `.htpasswd` file as follows:

   ```bash
   touch src/.htpasswd
   ```
   
3. Set the password for each user in turn as follows:

   ```bash
   htpasswd src/.htpasswd user1
   htpasswd src/.htpasswd user2
   htpasswd src/.htpasswd user3
   ```

#### Ansible

Deployment is performed using Ansible which can be configured in the `ansible` directory.

From the root directory of the project:

```bash
scripts/meeting deploy
```

Meeting currently makes use of upstart to configure Node.js as a service on Ubuntu systems as described in [this article](http://kvz.io/blog/2009/12/15/run-nodejs-as-a-service-on-ubuntu-karmic/).

_The current meeting service is configured to listen on port 3000 so you will likely need to add a firewall exception for this or configure a reverse proxy. Ultimately, it should be possible to change the service port within the Ansible configuration and the default will be set to port 80 as one might expect._
