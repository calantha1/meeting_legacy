# Meeting

Suite of applications for performing distributed group video conferences and managing shared meeting boards.

##Â Development

All development thus-far has been performed on OS X. It is anticipated that the same mechanisms described here will also work on Linux systems.

### Dependencies

From the root directory of the project:

```bash
# submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# global requirements
brew install ansible
brew install nodejs
brew install npm
npm install -g browserify
npm install -g nodemon

# local requirements
npm install
```

See the [React documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html#using-react-from-npm) for further notes on installation.

### Building

From the root directory of the project:

```bash
scripts/build build
```

### Running

```bash
node service.js
```

### Deploying

Deployment is performed using Ansible which can be configured in the `ansible` directory.

From the root directory of the project:

```bash
scripts/build deploy
```

Meeting currently makes use of upstart to configure Node.js as a service on Ubuntu systems as described in [this article](http://kvz.io/blog/2009/12/15/run-nodejs-as-a-service-on-ubuntu-karmic/).

_The current meeting service is configured to listen on port 3000 so you will likely need to add a firewall exception for this. Ultimately, it should be possible to change the service port within the Ansible configuration and the default will be set to port 80 as one might expect._
